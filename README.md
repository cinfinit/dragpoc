# Getting Started 

This project is live available on the following link  [Dragpoc](https://dragpoc.surge.sh).

## Running Project locally

To run the project locally ,
1. Go to the project directory
2. Run command "npm i"
(This basically  installs all the dependency , a folder named "node_modules" will be created)
3. Then run command "npm start"
(this will run the application locally , by default it runs on PORT 3000 if open , else you might be prompted to run it on different PORT)
4.Open localhost:PORT (what ever PORT number you got from previous step)
5. Enjoy :)
